Description:
This repository hosts the codebase for a comprehensive Learning Analytics Dashboard tailored for educators. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for teachers to effectively monitor, visualize, and analyze student performance data. It incorporates various features aimed at enhancing usability and aiding educators in making data-driven decisions to optimize learning outcomes.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Implemented secure authentication mechanisms using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that only authorized teachers can access the dashboard.
Visualization and Analysis: Utilized React for the frontend to create intuitive data visualizations and analysis tools, enabling educators to gain insights into student performance trends.
Batch-wise Sorting and Ranking: Developed features to facilitate batch-wise sorting and ranking of student performance data, allowing educators to easily identify top-performing students or areas requiring attention.
Predictive Analytics: Leveraged brain.js, a machine learning library, to provide accurate predictions of student marks based on historical data. This predictive capability assists educators in identifying at-risk students and implementing targeted interventions.
Statistics Module: Implemented a statistics module to generate comprehensive statistical summaries of student performance metrics, aiding educators in identifying patterns and trends.
Full-stack Architecture: Utilized a full-stack architecture with Express and Node.js for the backend, along with MongoDB for storing and managing student performance data.
Technology Stack:

Frontend: React
Backend: Express, Node.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Machine Learning: Brain.js
This Learning Analytics Dashboard serves as a powerful tool for educators to effectively track student progress, identify areas for improvement, and personalize learning experiences to meet the needs of individual students. It empowers educators with actionable insights derived from data analysis, ultimately contributing to enhanced teaching effectiveness and student success.
